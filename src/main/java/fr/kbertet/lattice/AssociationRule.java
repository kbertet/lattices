/**
 * This class gives a representation for an association rule.
 *
 * A rule is composed of a premise and a conclusion that are comparable sets,
 * i.e. sets of elements that can be sorted by the lectic order defined
 * by class `ComparableSet`.
 * An association rule extends regular rule with the notion of support and confidence.
 * The confidence represents the number of observations for which the rule is true.
 * The support represents the minimum number of observations for the rule to be relevant.
